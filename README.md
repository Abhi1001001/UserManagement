I made this project in React library. this is an user management app.<br/>
<h6>Project Setup:</h6>
<ul>
  <li><b>React</b> as framework</li>
  <li><b>Next ui</b> for the design components like the table, form, buttons, and layout.</li>
  <li><b>React router</b> for managing page navigation (between the homepage and the "Add User" form).</li>
</ul>
<h6>Componenets in this app:</h6>
<ul>
  <li><b>Home Component</b></li>
  This page contains a table that displays a list of users and an "Add User" button.<br/>
  Clicking the button will navigate to the page containing the user creation form.
  <li><b>AddUser Component</b></li>
  This is the page with a form to add a new user.<br/>
  Once the form is submitted, the new user data will popup in alert box and successfully added in API.
  <li><b>App Component</b></li>
  This file is where React Router is configured to manage navigation between the homepage and the add user page.
  <li><b>NextUI Components</b></li>
  This is a folder. The folder contains some inbuilt Next ui componenets which uses in table.
</ul>
